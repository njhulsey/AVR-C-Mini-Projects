# AVR-C-Mini-Projects
Learning AVR C projects
I began learning AVR C to code my Atmega328 breakout board instead of using the Arduino IDE. This has given me a deeper understanding of how microcontrollers operate on a lower level. 

Things I Learned:
- Bit Wise Operators
- Binary/Hex
- Atmel Studio
- Reading Datasheets
- Registers
- Interrupts
- Timing
- C
